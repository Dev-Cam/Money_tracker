## The What and the How
My first taste of building with React. 
I did my best to build a project with a few layers to make sure I understood how things worked. 

This was vastly different from my colour picker game because it was my introduction to using JSX so understanding that nothing was static anymore was really cool to me.

This project made me feel like I was beginning to grasp the basics and start to cement my fundamental knowledge of React.

## Learning
All things react, how components interacted with each other, state management and where to create it so that it was stored in the parent and passed up.
Working with props and understanding how they are passed down to then be returned to the parent.
JSX and learning that this is a much better way to code HTML to keep it dynamic.
Realising that chefs can learn new tricks or skills, Confidence began to grow with this project
